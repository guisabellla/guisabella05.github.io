            Ten Reasons You Should Love Your Cat
        </h1>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Your cat will follow you everywhere—bathroom, kitchen, even into your deepest thoughts. 
                    It is like having a fluffy stalker that you somehow find adorable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Forget snooze buttons—your cat’s version of waking you up includes paw slaps, face-sitting, and a dramatic hunger strike at 5 AM.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A shoebox? A salad bowl? Your laptop keyboard? If your cat fits, your productivity quits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They will silently judge your life choices—like that extra slice of pizza—but still expect premium food served in a timely manner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You thought the washing machine ate your socks? Nope, your cat has a hidden stash somewhere, and you will never find it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your cat suddenly becomes an Olympic sprinter at 3 AM, knocking over everything in its path like a chaotic little tornado.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nothing says “I love you” like a half-eaten rat or a mysteriously wet sock left on your pillow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Need a massage? Your cat will aggressively knead your stomach like it is making bread—whether you want it or not.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They will ignore you all day, but the second you are comfy in bed, they transform into a 200-degree heat source that refuses to move.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your cat thinks they own the house, and honestly, they are right. You just pay the bills and provide unlimited room service.
                </li>
            </ol>
